# Ann Security Monitor

Ann Security Monitor is a local, read-only monitoring module. It detects suspicious
login patterns and can, after an explicit user action, observe network packet
metadata for simple scan patterns.

## Privacy and safety boundaries

- Network capture is off by default.
- No packet payload is retained, displayed, decrypted, forwarded, blocked, or altered.
- Login events and alerts remain in `data/security_monitor/` under the Ann project.
- The module never disables accounts, revokes sessions, or changes firewall rules.
- Live capture requires an authorised environment. On Windows it generally requires
  Npcap and administrator permissions.

The normal root installation command installs Scapy because the root requirements
file includes this module's requirements. Ann does not install Scapy automatically
when it starts. If you are updating an existing environment manually, run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Commands

- `security open`
- `security status`
- `security alerts`
- `security pause` / `security resume`
- `security capture start [seconds]`
- `security capture stop`

## Data retention

The default retention period is 30 days. Change it in Security Center → Privacy & Data.

## Session pause

The Security Center's **Pause monitoring** control and `security pause` stop
monitoring only for the current Ann process. Ann automatically resumes the module
when it is launched again. Packet capture always remains explicitly started and
time-bounded.
